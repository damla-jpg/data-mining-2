2. **User Price Preference Difference**: The absolute difference between the displayed price of the hotel (`price_usd`) and the mean price per night the customer has previously purchased (`visitor_hist_adr_usd`). This feature can give an idea of how much the user is willing to pay compared to their past behavior.

4. **Search Day of Week and Hour**: Extract the day of the week and hour from the `date_time` field. Users might have different behaviors depending on the time of the search.

5. **Distance to Hotel Rank**: Rank hotels based on the distance to the customer's location (`orig_destination_distance`) within each search. A lower rank would mean the hotel is closer.

6. **Mean and Standard Deviation of Price Differences**: Compute the mean and standard deviation of the price difference between Expedia and each of its competitors.

7. **Competitor Price Difference Ratio**: Calculate the price difference ratio for each competitor, highlighting the relative pricing power of Expedia.

12. **Price Rank within Search**: Use the rank of the hotel's price compared to all other hotels returned in the search.

13. **Price Normalized by Length of Stay**: Normalize the `price_usd` by the `srch_length_of_stay` to get the price per day.

14. **Distance Normalized by Price**: Normalize the `orig_destination_distance` by `price_usd` to see the trade-off customers are making between price and distance.

15. **Adults to Room Ratio and Children to Room Ratio**: The ratios of `srch_adults_count` and `srch_children_count` to `srch_room_count`.

16. **Scaled Features**: Scale `price_usd`, `orig_destination_distance`, `prop_location_score1`, and `prop_location_score2` to a similar range.

17. **Booking Distance**: Combine `orig_destination_distance` and `srch_booking_window` to create a 'booking distance'.

18. **Hotel Similarity Score**: Combine several hotel features into a single 'hotel similarity score'.

19. **Past Preference Deviation**: Calculate the deviation of a hotel's features from the user's past preferences.

20. **Competitor Availability Score**: Combine the `compX_inv` variables to calculate a score that represents the overall availability of a hotel across competitors.

22. **User-Property Score**: Create a score combining `srch_adults_count`, `srch_children_count`, `srch_room_count`, and `srch_length_of_st
